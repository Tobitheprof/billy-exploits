# Billy Bets Exploit Repository

This repository provides a Python-based client for interacting with the **Billy Bets** platform via WebSocket, enabling real-time communication to send queries and receive responses regarding NFL statistics and other sports-related data. The client uses **Socket.IO** to establish and maintain a connection to the server and interact with its powerful query-answering backend.

### Features:
- Connect to the Billy Bets WebSocket server.
- Ask real-time sports-related questions (e.g., NFL stats).
- Receive dynamic responses to queries through a persistent WebSocket connection.
- Clean, object-oriented design for better maintainability and scalability.

### Requirements:
Just pip install the requirements.txt file 

### Security Note:
This repository serves as an example of how to interact with the Billy Bets platform. However, users should be cautious when exposing WebSocket endpoints publicly. **Unauthorized access**, **data leakage**, and **resource exhaustion** are potential risks if endpoints are not properly secured. This client can serve as a demonstration of such vulnerabilities if exploited by external parties, making proper authentication and rate-limiting mechanisms essential.

Ensure you have Python installed and follow best practices for securing WebSocket connections when working with any public API or service.

# Exploit One:

## Documentation of Vulnerability: WebSocket Exposure to External Parties

When exposing WebSocket endpoints to external parties without proper security measures like authentication and rate limiting, the following risks become significant:

### 1. Unauthorized Access:
If a WebSocket endpoint is publicly accessible, malicious users can easily connect to it without any authentication. They may:
- **Send bogus data**: Attackers can send crafted or incorrect data, which may overwhelm the server or bypass security checks, potentially exposing sensitive backend operations.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks**: By sending a high volume of requests in a short period, attackers can consume server resources, leading to service degradation or downtime for legitimate users.
- **Exploit unprotected features**: Attackers could make unauthorized queries, potentially retrieving data they should not have access to, such as private user information or system metrics.

### 2. Data Leakage:
Without proper safeguards, sensitive data may be inadvertently exposed. Exploiting a WebSocket endpoint can allow external parties to:
- **Capture structured responses**: Attackers could craft specific queries or use trial-and-error methods to access structured responses, including sensitive information such as user profiles, transaction details, or proprietary algorithms.
- **Misuse of real-time data**: Real-time systems like Billy Bets could expose live data that attackers could scrape and misuse for malicious purposes, including tracking user behaviors or leveraging competitive intelligence.

### 3. Resource Exhaustion:
WebSocket connections are persistent by nature, which makes them more prone to **resource exhaustion** than typical HTTP connections. Attackers can:
- **Flood the server with requests**: By maintaining a high volume of open WebSocket connections or spamming the server with messages, an attacker can exhaust memory, CPU, or bandwidth, leading to server crashes or unavailability.
- **Drain server-side resources**: Each open WebSocket connection consumes server resources. Large-scale attacks could result in servers not being able to handle legitimate traffic.

## Mitigation Techniques:

### 1. Authentication:
Implementing authentication ensures that only legitimate users can access the WebSocket endpoint. Possible approaches include:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Require clients to present valid JWT tokens for every WebSocket connection. These tokens can be validated on the server to ensure the request is from an authorized source.
- **OAuth**: Integrate OAuth-based authentication to securely identify and authorize clients before establishing a connection.
- **Session-based Authentication**: Implement a session management system that tracks authenticated users and checks session validity for each WebSocket connection.

### 2. Rate Limiting:
To mitigate denial-of-service or brute-force attacks, apply rate-limiting mechanisms:
- **Limit connection rates**: Set a cap on how frequently a client can establish WebSocket connections or send messages within a specific time window.
- **IP-based throttling**: Restrict the number of requests or messages from a single IP address or a group of suspicious IPs to prevent abuse.
- **Exponential backoff**: Use backoff algorithms to slow down repeated requests from clients that are hitting the rate limit.


### 3. Input Validation:
Strict validation of incoming data can prevent injection attacks and other types of malicious input:
- **Sanitize incoming queries**: Ensure that all user input (especially SQL queries) is sanitized and validated to prevent SQL injection or command injection attacks.
- **Enforce data formats**: Define and enforce strict data formats or schemas for incoming messages, rejecting any messages that don't conform.
- **Limit message size**: Restrict the maximum size of incoming WebSocket messages to prevent resource-intensive payloads from being processed by the server.

### Conclusion:
Implementing these security techniques is crucial to protect WebSocket endpoints from being exploited by malicious users. By requiring authentication, applying rate-limiting, enforcing secure connections, and validating input, you can significantly reduce the risk of attacks and ensure the robustness of your WebSocket-based system.

# Explot Two:
### Overview
The `ChatSessionManager` class allows interaction with the Billy Bets platform's chat system through HTTP requests. However, if not properly secured, the chat session management API can be vulnerable to a variety of security risks. Below is a detailed description of the potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies to secure your application.

### Potential Vulnerabilities

1. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - **Description**: If the chat API endpoints are publicly exposed without proper authentication, malicious actors can exploit the system by generating or retrieving chat sessions they are not authorized to access. This could include unauthorized users sending queries to the platform or accessing confidential data.
   - **Risk**: An attacker could send multiple queries, manipulate chat sessions, or even retrieve sensitive information using brute-forced or guessed `chat_id`s.

2. **Data Leakage**:
   - **Description**: If the chat data is not protected with adequate encryption or authentication, sensitive information (e.g., user queries, session IDs) can be leaked. This is particularly critical if the chat data includes any personally identifiable information (PII) or confidential user inputs.
   - **Risk**: Data intended for legitimate users could be intercepted or retrieved by unauthorized parties, leading to privacy breaches.

3. **Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)**:
   - **Description**: Without rate limiting, an attacker could flood the server with requests to create or retrieve chat sessions, overwhelming system resources. This could result in slow response times or crashes, rendering the service unavailable to legitimate users.
   - **Risk**: Uncontrolled resource usage could bring down the server or cause major performance issues.

### Mitigation Techniques

To protect the application and its data, it's important to implement the following security measures:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - **Solution**: Ensure all API endpoints require proper authentication (e.g., OAuth2, API keys) to ensure only authorized users can access the system. Authorization should be role-based, limiting the actions each user can take based on their permissions.
   - **Benefit**: This will prevent unauthorized users from accessing chat sessions or sending bogus data.

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - **Solution**: Implement rate-limiting mechanisms to cap the number of API requests (chat creation, retrieval, etc.) a user can make in a specific time frame (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
   - **Benefit**: Helps mitigate resource exhaustion attacks by preventing excessive requests from a single user or IP address.
4. **Input Validation**:
   - **Solution**: Strictly validate and sanitize any incoming requests (e.g., user messages, chat IDs). This ensures that invalid or malicious inputs (like SQL injections or malformed data) are not processed by the server.
   - **Benefit**: Prevents injection attacks and unexpected input handling, ensuring system integrity.

5. **Session Management**:
   - **Solution**: Implement secure session management practices, including using long, random `chat_id`s that are difficult to guess. Expire old sessions and implement session timeouts for inactive users.
   - **Benefit**: This reduces the risk of session hijacking and ensures that old, unused sessions are not exploited.

### Conclusion

The `ChatSessionManager` provides a powerful way to interact with the Billy Bets platform, but without appropriate security controls, the system is vulnerable to various attacks, including unauthorized access, data leakage, and denial of service. Proper authentication, encryption, rate limiting, and input validation are essential to ensuring the platform's security and protecting user data.

Be sure to implement these practices to safeguard your application

# Exploit Three:

Now, Exploit Two may seem small just take a look at how it can be paired with Exploit three to do some major damage.

# Data Exposure Risks in User Profiles

The returned data from the Supabase API contains sensitive information related to users, including:

1. **User Identification**:
   - Each user has a unique identifier (`user_id`), which can be used to target specific accounts.

2. **Personal Information**:
   - **Display Name**: Even if some users have a null display name, the presence of a display name for others may provide identifiable information.
   - **Email Address**: The email addresses can be exploited for phishing attacks, spam, or other malicious activities.

3. **Chat Identifiers**:
   - The `chats` array contains unique identifiers for each chat associated with the user. An attacker gaining access to these IDs could potentially manipulate or access chat data, depending on how the system handles these identifiers.

4. **Account Creation Date**:
   - The `created_at` timestamp can provide insights into user behavior patterns, such as how long they have been using the service.

## Potential Risks:

1. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - If an attacker can connect to the API without proper authentication, they could gain access to the full user dataset. This unauthorized access could lead to the exploitation of private chats and user information.

2. **Data Breach**:
   - Exposure of user IDs, email addresses, and chat identifiers poses a risk of data breaches. Attackers could compile this information for targeted attacks, including social engineering and credential stuffing.

3. **Privacy Violations**:
   - The ability to correlate user IDs with chat identifiers could lead to privacy violations. An attacker might be able to reconstruct conversations or gain insights into sensitive discussions that users believed were private.

4. **Chat Manipulation**:
   - If the API does not properly validate user access rights for the chat identifiers, an attacker could potentially interact with or manipulate chats that do not belong to them.

5. **Account Compromise**:
   - Gaining access to user data such as email addresses can facilitate phishing attempts, where attackers pose as legitimate entities to extract further sensitive information or compromise user accounts.

## Mitigation Strategies:

To reduce these risks, consider implementing the following strategies:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Enforce strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to ensure that only legitimate users can access their profiles and associated data. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access based on user roles.

2. **Data Minimization**:
   - Only return necessary data. For instance, consider omitting sensitive fields like email addresses unless absolutely required for the application’s functionality.

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API by automated scripts or malicious users.

4. **Data Encryption**:
   - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting it from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

5. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate and sanitize all incoming requests to protect against injection attacks and unauthorized data manipulation.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Continuously monitor API usage and maintain logs to detect and respond to unusual activities promptly.

By recognizing these risks and implementing robust security measures, developers can help safeguard user data and maintain trust in their applications.
